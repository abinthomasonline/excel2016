        <p>'Untitled' is set to hear stories of people who dared to shift gears and tread on a new self-made path. We present to you ‘UNTITLED- The 90 Degree Turn’! The event will celebrate the lives of those who gave up on their basic study and profession, to chase their passion and dreams. The speakers will get to share their story of taking ‘the turn’, the struggle they had and the ultimate success.</p>

        <p>The first session of the event will have the speakers talk about their 90 Degree turn from Engineering and Software background to creative and unconventional avenues. The later half will have stories of people whose 90 Degree Turn made a social impact and touched the lives of many. The stage is then open to questions and interaction of the audience with the speakers.</p>
