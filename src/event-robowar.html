			<p>&#10003; Each team can have up to four members.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Registrations close at 10.00 am of the day of event.</p>
			<p>&#10003; It is not mandatory for all the members of a team to be from the same institution.</p>
			<p>&#10003; The Robot must be manually controlled through wired/wireless interface.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Maximum permitted dimensions of the robot are 45 cm X 45 cm X 45 cm and its weight must not exceed 15 kg. 10% tolerance in weight and dimensions are allowed.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Each robot must have its own power supply not exceeding 24V. However a power point(230V AC) will be provided for recharging batteries or to power your supply.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Far-fetched ideas of implementing fire, lubricants,cutting blades,rotating weights etc. for attack will not be entertained. If any bot found unsafe for audience, will not be allowed to participate.</p>
			<p>&#10003; All teams will have to have their bots inspected by the coordinators both before and after each stage.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Teams are permitted to make minor changes to the body of their robot after every stage if they wish; but modifying the entire body of the robot will not be permitted.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Arena will be disclosesd only at the time of the event.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Only two members from each team are allowed to operate the bot during each stage.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Both members are allowed to control the bot staying behind the board. So the wire must be of sufficient length in order to cover the entire arena.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Any team/team member found disrespecting the rules/other competitors, will be disqualified.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Bonus points will be announced one hour prior to the event.</p>
			<p>&#10003; Coordinators can change the event format at any time during the event.</p>
			<p>&#10003; The decision of the judges will be final and binding.</p>

            <p>&#10003; Cross-college teams are allowed.</p>
            <p>&#10003; Malpractices and sabotaging other teams' machines will lead to immediate disqualification.</p>
            <p>&#10003; Organizers reserve the right to make decisions in case of conflicts and other issues.</p>
