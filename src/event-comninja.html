		<h2>Help Chris build an online store.</h2>
    <p>Chris owns a shoe store and wishes to start an online store. His usual customers buy from the store promotions. These promotions are based on new arrivals, best sellers, clearance etc.</p>

    <p>The event requires participants to build a website that will have landing pages for the different promotions. The user should be able to search for shoes on the site. On clicking on the desired shoe model the user should be directed to the details page. The user should go through the checkout process from there. </p>

    <h2>Event Description</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Duration of the event is 12 days. Last day for submission of prototypes is 3rd Oct 2016, please send the entries to contest@mcfadyen.com</li>
      <li>The event comprises of 3 stages:
        <ul>
          <li>First Stage - Create a prototype (12 Days) : A concept will be provided to the teams for which they will have to develop a prototype (working model). They also need to make a presentation on the subject which should contain the workflow, technologies used, known issues, etc. (creativity is the key here!). Database connectivity is a plus but not mandatory. The prototype has to be submitted using GIT. Note - The presentations need not be submitted in GIT. You can Wow us on the event day.</li>
          <li>Second Stage - Presentation (20 mins) : The shortlisted teams will have to present the project workflow. Every team member should get a role in this presentation. The teams may use any visual representations like Powerpoint presentations or Charts.  This will be followed by a Q &amp; A session.</li>
          <li>Third Stage - Enact scenario (10 mins prep time, 10 mins enact time). For the final stage, the shortlisted teams will have to enact a scenario. The scenarios will be based on vendor-customer interactions. When one team acts as the customer, the other would act as the vendor. Negotiation skills, temperament and ability to handle situations would be keenly observed in this round, based on which the final winner would be decided.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The teams should fill <a class="file" target="_blank" href="../resources/static/Teamdetails.docx">this</a> form and mail it to excel@mec.ac.in, along with each member'sâ€™ resume. </li>
      <li>This event is a platform for McFadyen to identify talents who wish to pursue a career in Web technologies.</li>
    </ol>
