        	<p>The top 4 teams of round two, contest in the final round. The contestants will be required to debug/Design an Analog/Digital circuit within the stipulated time. The team which debugs/designs the circuit first will be declared the winner. In case of tie or no output, performance of teams in the second round is analysed, on the basis of which the final decision will be made.</p>
