		<p>Don’t forget your grey cells at home as they may be the only things of any use to you in this grueling code duel. A call to each and every coder out there to prove their programming mettle. Join the war and beat your fellow coders in an all out battle to determine the true champions of the coding arena.</p>
		<h3>Event Format</h3>
		<p>#include is an individual online competition that will test the language versatility and coding skills. The competition is meant to test the C/C++/Java/Python Programming skills of the students. In this event, there will be 3 levels, and it is based on points. The coder can attempt any questions at any time. The code can be submitted either by uploading an appropriate file or by writing it online.</p>

        <li> Hard - 10 points.</li>

			<p>&#10003;This is strictly an individual online event. </p>
			<p>&#10003; The duration of the event is 7 days (10080 minutes).</p>
			<p>&#10003;Registration is required for participation and there should be no duplicate accounts. </p>
			<p>&#10003;Codes should be in C/C++/Java/Python v2.7. </p>
			<p>&#10003;There will be a total of 30 questions. </p>
			<p>&#10003;The program submitted by the participant will be considered correct if it gives the expected output for all the test cases. </p>
			<p>&#10003;Participants can compile and test the code before submitting. If it shows 'All sample test cases passed' during testing and still shows 'Wrong Answer' after submission, it is a presentation error. It can be avoided by properly formatting the output. </p>
			<p>&#10003; The ranking is done as follows:</p>
			
			
			<ul>
				<li>The one with the highest score is ranked first.</li>
				<li>In case if 2 or more persons have the same score, then they are ranked by whoever obtained the total points first.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&#10003;A live points table will be maintained so that the participant can check his/her ranking </p>
			<p>&#10003; If any malicious activity like submitting the duplicate code is detected the user account will be deleted without prior notice.</p>
