      <ol>
        <li>This on-the-spot event bears resemblance to a 4*100m athletic relay race. Four members of the team with one relay which is your computer. Each member makes an attempt at solving the problem statement by continuing from where the previous member left off.The fastest and the smartest team shall win the race.</li>
        <li>The event comprises of two stages.</li>
        <li>Preliminary round consists of both objective and subjective type tests. After the preliminary round, eight teams with the highest scores will be selected for the final round.</li>
        <li>Final round comprises of 3 questions. The team can skip a question and move on to the next question, but no discussion would be allowed within the team. The decision of the team member is applicable to the whole team.</li>
        <li>The team members must decide which order they wish to follow before the final round question has been provided, and will not be allowed to change this order. The question will be provided to each member only at the start of their time slot, and not before the first member's time slot. Once the question has been provided, each member can code for 3 minutes at the beginning.</li>
        <li>In the first 30 minutes, each member can code for 3 mins. In the next 30 mins, the coding time increases to 4 mins. In the next 30 minutes, coding takes place for 5 minutes. In the final 30 minutes, each member gets 2 minutes to code.</li>
        <li>Duration for the final round is two hours. The teams that get the desired output in the shortest time stand a chance to win the prize money.</li>
