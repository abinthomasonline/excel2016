		<p>4 people and 120 seconds of synchronous understanding and unrivalled teamwork separate the winners from the others. The best teams that we have encountered have a few things in common :teamwork, impeccable sync, immeasurable confidence in each other and the ability to pick up from where his predecessor left, better his effort and win the title. Time is of essence here and teams not in sync fall apart.</p>

        <h3>Final Round</h3>
        <p>Final round comprises of 3 questions. The team can skip a question and move on to the next question, but no discussion would be allowed within the team. The decision of the team member is applicable to the whole team.</p>
        <p>The team members must decide which order they wish to follow before the final round question has been provided, and will not be allowed to change this order.</p>
        <p>The question will be provided to each member only at the start of their time slot, and not before the first member's time slot. Once the question has been provided, each member can code for 3 minutes at the beginning.</p>
        <p>In the first 30 minutes, each member can code for 3 mins. In the next 30 mins, the coding time increases to 4 mins. In the next 30 minutes, coding takes place for 5 minutes. In the final 30 minutes, each member gets 2 minutes to code.</p>
        <p>Duration for the final round is two hours. The teams that get the desired output in the shortest time stand a chance to win the prize money.</p>
