	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<p>A chance to comprehend the substantial difference between “posting an idea” and “making an idea into a reality”. Teams are tasked with converting a simple concept into a finalized model using the necessary parts, technical prowess and ofcourse - their team spirit.</p>
		<p>Hopefully you have the stamina to endure this marathon</p>
		<p>Techathon aims to provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds (group of 3-5 members) come together, form teams around an idea, and collaboratively, try to code a unique solution.</p>
		<p>Interested candidates may register online as well as on the first day of Excel.</p>
		<p>Groups consisting of at least 3 and at most 5 members can participate.</p>
